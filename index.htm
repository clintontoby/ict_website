            <h3>INVERTER & BATTERY</h3>
            <p>an inverter is a device used to convert direct current (DC) power into alternating current (AC) power. This conversion is necessary because many data center components and equipment, including servers, typically operate on AC power. Inverters ensure that the DC power from backup sources, such as batteries or generators, can be converted to AC power to maintain continuous operation during power outages or fluctuations.</p>
